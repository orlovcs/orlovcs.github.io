1. 1.Policy - Goals (priority in CIA) Responsibility (who responsible) Commitment (org chart for sec)
2. 2.Current State - Risk analysis &amp; what to do with new additions, Privacy Impact Assessment
3. 3.Requirements - Who is allowed to do what? **Nothing to do with mechanism**

  -\&gt; Arrange regular backups, stockpile supplies, train employees

  Risk has probability and impact; risk exposure = probability \* impact

  Risk analysis:

1. 1.Identify assets - Hard/Software/Data, People, Docs, Supplies
2. 2.Determine vulnerabilities - Come up with attacks
3. 3.Estimate likelihood of exploitation - Frequency analysis (how often in the past?)
4. 4.Compute risk exposure - Competitor having/not having data
5. 5.Survey applicable controls - Ways to control vulnerability
6. 6.Project savings = Risk Exposure - Cost of control - New risk exposure;
7. 7.Physical Security
8. 8.Physical Threats

  Tiger Teams break into system for a price

  Legal Protections against threats

  IP Kinds Differ:

  Violating digital lock does not carry significant penalties

  Computer Crime

  Early laws were bizarre - value of stolen data was worth as much as the paper it was printed on

  Computer forensics replaces regular forensics

  Worse that computer crime is international

  Bill C-13 or Cyberbullying law is really a lawful access law

  UK, RIP Act - Full backdoor

  Full disclosure - post full leaks, provide vendors incentives to fix problem
